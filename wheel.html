<h2>Message 6. 5. 2020 <br> Conference Prayer for Regional Coordinators </h2>
<b><p style="font-size: 20px";>Dan 4:13, 14  'I saw in the visions of my head on my bed, and behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from the sky He cried aloud, and said thus, Cut down the tree, and cut off its branches! Shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit! Let the animals get away from under it, and the fowls from its branches. <br><br>
The command has come from heaven to cut down the tree; and cut off its branches.<br>
Tree - The Roman Catholic Church and its branches are all its sister concerns which follow the same hierarchical, institutional, organizational pattern of the Church. <br>
Its leaves - All the other churches with one pastor as head
Scatter its fruit - believers who are scattered because of the lock down of the whole world. <br>
They are real fruits grown in the tree. So far the institutional Churches were keeping them under their custody protected. Now they are scattered. It is the time for the real Church. - Troop Church.
Let us go and collect the scattered ones from the field like Ruth.
Joh 4:38  I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.<br>
Troop Churchers!<br>
You are entering into the labour of others!<br>
You are entering into the area of institutional Churches!<br>
Lord is giving them into your hands!<br>
Rom 16:20 And the God of peace will quickly crush Satan under your feet. <br>
Yesterday the Lord showed  satan being defeated and remaining under our feet.<br> 
Dan 4:15 Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of the sky. <br>
The stump - The real Church which Jesus Christ established on earth.. It will be left with a band of iron and brass. Church gatherings will be allowed on earth with a lot of conditions and regulations equivalent to bands of iron and brass so that it will not go back to the old condition.<br>
In Kerala all the 6 days people and vehicles are allowed to move around on the road. But on Sunday everything banned. <br>
Dan 4:17  The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones; to the intent that the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will, and sets up over it the lowest of men. <br>
The Most High is establishing His Government in India and gives it to whomever He will and set up over it the lowest of men, who are  conducting His real Church and making disciples  in remote areas without any publicity, without expecting anything from the sheep. <br>
Certain things to note:<br>
<ul style="font-size: 18px;"><li>1.Daniel was named Belteshazzar, after the god of the king. 
Dan 4:8  But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods. I told the dream before him, saying, </li>
<li>2. Daniel was called the Master of magicians.
Dan 4:9 Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no secret troubles you.
The Institutional Church system is broken.  Believers (Pastors) can go to work anywhere.  The Lord will glorify His name by doing miracles.</li></ul></p>

<h2> Message  29.4.2020</h2>
<b><p style="font-size: 20px";>Jn 20:19  Then the same day at evening, being the first of the sabbaths, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, Peace to you! <br>
When all the doors are shut where the disciples are assembled for fear of the virus, Jesus comes and stand in our  midst and say to us, Peace be to you .<br>
Jos 6:1,2  And Jericho was completely shut up because of the sons of Israel. None went out and none came in.  And Jehovah said to Joshua, See, I have given Jericho into your hand, and its king, and the mighty men of war. <br>
When the whole world is completely shut up, nobody goes out, and none coming in, Jehovah is telling us, “I have given this land India into your hand  and its kings, and the mighty men of war.<br>
We have been praying for so many things separately,
For the closing of Casinos, bars, dance club, night clubs, adultery, idolatry, worship places, pilgrimages, trip to gurus, conventions, crusades, lavish spending, vulgar display of money, oppressing the poor, injustice, robbery, murder, etc.<br>
A tiny invisible virus sent by God brought the reply for all. 
Now our work of making disciples  has to start in full swing.  Let us start harvesting.<br>
These days Gifts Schools are attracting many participants across the nation and even from other countries. <br>
 In Gift School, the most important class is <b>Troop Church</b>.
All other classes are preparation for it. <br>
Mat 28:19,20  Therefore go and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,  teaching them to observe all things, whatever I commanded you. And, behold, I am with you all the days until the end of the world. Amen. 
Making disciples happen in <b>Troop Church</b>.  Here the participants are divided into groups of ten. You get 10 Troop Church members  without any effort of your own. They have come from various Churches to attend our gift school.  You have not sown, you have not watered but now you can reap.<br>
Let’s see how? <br>
We are changing the Lesson of Troop Church to the first day, that is 4th lesson. (It was the last one)<br>
If there are 70 students for a gift School, they are divided into 7 Troops and one coordinator will be appointed to conduct the Troop. He is the Troop Church leader.<br>
Even after the Gift class is over, this Troop Church leader will continue running this Troop Church, since the  participants know each other and they got a chance to fellowship with each other. 
They will continue running this Troop Church with the same members, for 8 days (weeks) as per the rules of TCs  and  within that period, they should be motivated to gather 10 people from anywhere and start a Troop of their own. By that time they would have become well versed in conducting Troop Church. So they can conduct a Troop Church pretty well.
They became disciples by giving fruits (souls for Jesus Christ)
They started making disciples. (gathered 10 members). If they need help in conducting the new Troop Church, for one or 2 weeks helps can be given.<br> 
All the papers,<br>
Troop Application<br>
Troop Gathering<br>
Report Form should be given to them and taught to fill up.<br>
By attending Gift School, they gain 5 things<br></p>
<ol><li> Become disciples of Jesus Christ</li>
<li> Make 10 disciples</li> 
<li> Identify their calling and gifts</li>
<li> Grow in the gifts given to them</li>
<li> With the  first 10, go on multiplying  disciples for Jesus Christ </li></ol>
<b><p style="font-size: 20px";>What a privilege to conduct a Gift School!<br>
In 8 days you become 10!<br>
In 16 days you become 100!<br>
In 24 days you become 1000!<br>
In 32 days you become 10,000!<br>
In 40 days you become 1,00,000!<br>
In the 40 days of lock down, you could have become 1,00,000! <br>
If you missed the chance, let us try from today!<br>
Without starting  Troop Churches, if you simply leave the participant after the Gift School,<br>
We are conducting another Bible College! Danger!<br>
Let’s be alert!<br>
Isa 60:22  A little one will become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I Jehovah will hasten it in its time. <br>
Jehovah is hastening because this is the time for it. <br>
Come on soldiers! Lets fill the  nation with Troop Churches! <br><br></p>

<h2> 22.4.2020 Conference Prayer for Regional Coordinators  - Message  </h2>
<b><p style="font-size: 20px";>There shall be a time of trouble, such as never was
Dan 12:1  And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.<br> 
The world is facing such a time now, a time of trouble unprecedented  in the history of humanity. But there is a good news for his children. 
Thy people shall be delivered. Everyone that shall be found written in the book.</p><br> 
<p> When were your name added into the book? <br> 
<ol><li>When you committed to obey the commandment of Jesus Mat 28:19,20</li>
<li>	When you decided to come out of the dead Church</li>
<li>	When you started to teach others the commandments of Jesus</li>
<li>When you started teaching to observe all things whatsoever Jesus commanded us</li>
<li>	When you decided to give baptism </li>
<li>	 When you decided to exercise the authority Jesus gave to you</li>
<li>	When you were recruited into His Army to fight with satan for Him</li>
<li>	When you started loving Jesus more than your father, mother, brothers, sisters wife, husband, children </li></ol></p>
<p>When the Lord gave the strategy of Troop Church we travelled from one end to the other end of India to propagate this. The first question people asked invariably was<br>
If we leave the institutional Church, where will we get grave?”<br>
Second question was,<br>
How will we solemnize the marriage of our children.
These two have become the priority of Christians in the institutional Churches. They have come to such a comfortable state to forget about the evangelizing duty  of the Church, reaching out the gentiles, preaching gospel and  renouncing all securities for the sake of gospel.<br> 
Celebrating marriage function, funeral service in the most attractive way has become the fashion of the Churches this day.<br>
I was recollecting verses from the Bible of  funeral and burial issues.<br> </p>
<p>Isa 53:9  And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. 
In the modern society, there has been a tendency to believe that a good Christian is the one who gets a decent death and a decent burial. The family members consider it as their duty to conduct the burial service as ostentatious  as possible. Christians do not seem to worry much about where the soul goes after death or about the eternal life but they make the funeral service a real show.<br> 
Most of the Christians who have membership in any one of the organizational Churches will have the first guarantee of a burial place.<br></p>
<p>Jesus  got grave with the wicked. He died on the cross, crucified in the middle of two robbers.<br>
Paul said,<br>
Php 3:10  That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;<br> 
Paul wanted to be in conformity with Christ in His death.<br> 
Can Christian desire for a better burial and funeral other than that of Jesus Christ?<br></p>
<p>Yesterday I went through  a media narration of what happened to the body of Dr. Simon Hercules, a Christian Neurologist who was running a Hospital in the heart of the city of Chennai under the name New Hope Hospital. He was tested positive 15 days back, admitted to the best renowned hospital Appollo in Chennai. After 15 days he succumbed to the attack of Covid 19 & breathed his last. After all the formalities, the dead body was taken to the burial ground. But the nearby people, did not allow his body to be buried. According to the video narration, they brought gundas to attack  the van and those who were  inside the van. After trying to convince them in vain, the body was taken to another burial ground and buried.<br></p>
<p>This is the second incident happening in Chennai. The earlier was also that of a doctor from Nellore who died in Chennai. When his body was brought to the burial ground by the hospital workers, the  inhabitants of that area gave problems to them. It ended up in leaving  the body in the burial ground. It was left there unclaimed. After that the police  interfered and the body was buried.<br></p>
<p>What all these incidents tell us?<br>
The Lord is teaching the Church and the people who had made secure their burial ground, the  lesson of a  true believer’s concept on death and burial.<br><p> 
<p>Mat 27:58  He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.<br>
Jesus was aware of his death, burial and the rituals of Jews to be done during burial. He knew none of these will be done to His body during burial.<br>
Mar 14:8  She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.<br>
Jesus asked us not  to be  bothered about the physical death.<br> 
Luk 12:4  And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.
Jesus knew His body will be broken to pieces.<br> 
Jesus body was given a decent burial as per the Jews even though Jesus did not plan for it. The Father Almighty had planned it.<br>
Joh 19:40  Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.<br>
As long as we are in this body, we are away from God. Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: </p>
<p>2Co 5:1-6  For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.  For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven: If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.  For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.  Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.<br> 
Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: <br>
Let us pray for the health workers, doctors, nurses, other staffs of hospitals, police and people who are serving in the public utility services. </p><br><br>

<h2>21.3.2020 <br>
Message for  Speakers</h2>
<p>Exo 11:1  And Jehovah said to Moses, I will still bring one plague yet on Pharaoh and on Egypt. Afterward he will let you go from here. When he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out from here altogether. <p>

<ol>From the day Moses stood in front of Pharaoh, upto   Exo 11:1, it was a long process.<br>
The milestones of Model Church (Troop Church) can be narrated like this.
<li>	1998- Troop Meeting was introduced  in 1998</li>
<li>	2001 -When opposition came from Catholic Church for conducting Troop meetings in houses,   the Shekinah Evangelization  Programme was given in 2001 through which the Lord sent thousands of people to be trained in Troop Church. </li>
<li>	2006 – The Lord gave  Vision about India & Model Church  - He revealed that He is going to change the whole pattern of the Church in the world. "Model Church" revelation was  the first  warning given to institutional  Church.</li>
<li>	2012.  Even though the visions were shared among the Churches in India & abroad, very few leaders could understand it. They did not cooperate. In 2012, August 14, the Lord revealed that "Institutional Churches" are my enemy with whom I have declared war. The Army of Jesus has to be with the Lord in this fight. "I am making a division in my Church" . Saul, the institutional Church will be hunting  the life of David (Troop Church) . It has to be protected carefully. From then we cut off the relationships with the institutional Church heads and started ministering to the believers who are in the work place.  Hence we had to face strong opposition too.</li>
<li>	2013- Warning of Operation Ecclesia. "If you continue to disobey, I will hand over my Church to gentiles for purifying it."</li>
<li>	2014 – Famine Years started. Persecution for the Church in India also started.</li>
<li>	27.10.2014 -  Third warning for the Church – The Lord gave the 7 fold agenda to the Church in order  to escape from the persecution</li>
<li>	6.8.2014 – Installation of Troop Church (6.8.2014) and starting of Gift Schools</li>
<li>	10.10.2015. Rejection of the Institutional Churches. Jer 6:29,30 -> Started with Jer. 1:10</li>
<li>	2016 – Jer 31:28. "I am going to build up my Church". Troop Churches (Churches of 10 members gathering in houses) started spreading throughout India through  BFF Trainings and Gift School Trainings.</li>
<li>	 2017 - Revelation of  Forgiveness and Reconciliation Programme (FRP) – Introduced this to the Church in India</li>
<li>	2018 - Warning to the persecuted Church – written revelation handed over to the Internuncio of Delhi and Archbishop of Delhi.</li>
<li>	2019 – Anti Christian Government at the Centre established with absolute majority- Church in India was facing great turmoil and opposition but still The Church heads did not allow  their people to worship the Lord freely. The Lord asked the Army of Jesus to appoint shadow mps and make them stand around India in 543 Constituencies.</li> 
<li>	2020. The Lord gave the message of "Shout" and inherit. 2 Chro 13:15. Month of January was given to inherit all the Constituencies of India.  31.1.2020 was the deadline.</li>
<li>	2020 Feb. The  plague corona virus make the heads of Institution Churches make announcements to the Churches
"Don't come to the Church. Worship in your houses" No lent, no Sunday classes, no Lord's supper..
If anybody happens to die, you should not bring the body to the Church. You may directly take it to the tomb and bury.</li>
<p><b>I will still bring one plague yet on Pharaoh and on Egypt. Afterward he will let you go from here. When he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out from here altogether.</b><br> 
Now at the end   the people of God are released to worship the Lord in Spirit and truth, gathering  in their houses without any mediators. It took  long 13 years for this process to complete and it took the toll of   thousands of lives and the making  the whole humanity on the earth walk through  the valley of death,  leaving them in uncertainty, economic crisis, endless fear and panic and so on.<br> 
Lord you are the same 4000 years ago, today and tomorrow. You are the one who did miracles in Egypt to liberate your children from the slavery of Pharaoh. Today also you did the same miracle, even sent a plague, in order to release your children from the slavery of Institutional, Churches with manmade leaderships. <br>
Let us  plead for mercy from the  Lord.  He will look down on us with pity, look down from heaven . He will not allow His children  to perish. At the same time, He will make His  judgments and His righteousness  revealed to humanity. </p><br><br>

<h2> 22.2.2020, Saturday, 6.00-7.00 am<br>
    Sheep did not hear them!</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Joh 10:8 All who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.<br>  
On 17.2.2020 Monday, while coming back from the station, we hired a taxi. The driver was an anti-Christian.  He went on criticizing and accusing Christians & Jesus. When he spoke about Jesus, I felt bad and hence replied.<br> 
"Where was he born? Is there His name mentioned in Bible?" He asked ridiculously.<br> 
I replied,<br> 
"We Christians, have failed to follow Jesus Christ's principles. That's true. But Jesus is a living God. He did not create any religion. He showed only a way, way to heaven.  He carried our sins, curses, died and resurrected. He is the living God. Don't accuse Jesus because of our mistakes."<br>
He continued,<br>
"In Jesus Christ's name, (oru paradesi) one sojourner, (by name) who was lying  in the platform, started a ministry. Now he is a correlating with so many buildings, acres of land etc. Isn't it all people's money? Is he not robbing people in God's name? He says, "don't wear ornaments. Give it all to me as offerings!  Is it not robbery?"<br>
First I felt angry at this driver.  But Slowly I came to realize the truth, this is the image Christianity, we, have  given to the common man in India.<br>
In between, even he was attending a phone call (I think from his sister, it was on speaker so we could also hear,) "Anna, why are you continuously driving like this? Can’t you take rest at least once in two or three days?<br> 
His reply:  'That's O.K ma. I need some money now.  So I am driving continuously for  30 hours. I take bath in the public pipes. If I need rest, I will halt the car on the roadside for some time. Don't worry. If I come that side, I will visit you".<br>
After listening to this phone call, my bitterness towards him started melting, I felt like listening to him. <br>  
In a country where people are working even 30 hours continuously for making both ends meet, what is the image Christianity offered for Jesus?
Christianity is easy going life, making windfall money, etc.etc.
Is there any contributions we, Christians have made to the development of this nation? Hon’ble Arvind Kejriwal, CM Delhi, who has presented a clean Govt is from Hindu background who has received inspiration from Jesus and Bible. No Church has claim over him.<br> 
'All who came before Jesus, were thieves and robbers ' Jesus said. Let us analyze this “All" category! <br>
1. Kings. From Saul to Zedekiah all the kings exploited and killed people in thousands and lakhs, for making their throne secure, and to pass it on to their children.<br>
2. Prophets. Who were appointed and maintained in paid profession, by kings in the palace, to give the brand 'seal of God'  to all that the atrocities the  kings did.<br> 
3. The priests. Who lived on the clean tithe of the people who did not do any work at all?<br>
All these three were robbers & thieves, the Lord said.
Now today, what about all those who came after Jesus?<br><br>

In N.T. the Lord destroyed all the above 3 categories of O.T. (Priest, individual prophet & king). <br>
Today believers are the kings and priests. Rev. 5:10, 1 Pe 2:9, Rev 1:6
Rev 5:10 And You made us kings and priests to our God, and we will reign over the earth. <br> 
But the institutional Church has brought back the old system of 'robbers & thieves'. <br><br> 

What is the result?<br>
"But the sheep did not hear them".<br>
Today the common man in India, (123 crores out of 128 crores), do not want to listen to any pastor, any evangelist. <br> 
In these 7 years (2014-2020) the Lord has exposed the robberies, crimes, exploitation and discriminations done by the Church (inside & outside). 
The Lord did it with the help of Central and local governments. 
So let us be careful, not to exploit, steal or rob from  any man or woman!  Never let us eat people's money or labor! Keeping ourselves away from the above, is our first duty!  Expecting nothing from the people, not even a thanks! <br>
2 Co 1:24 Not that we have dominion over your faith, but we are helpers of your joy; for by faith you stand.<br> 
<ul style="font-size: 20px;">Never have dominion over the faith of people!
<li>2. Equip each one as Disciples 
Let us   equip the people to be disciples of Jesus Christ, to teach them,  how  to exercise  all the gifts of the Holy Spirit ( theory and practice).<br>
What we have lost in 2000 years can be compensated this way 
<li>3. Make each one a leader in Jesus Christ 
Develop their human skills also! The skill of leadership, skill of writing, the skill of singing,
o	the skill of teaching, the skill of communication, skill of hospitality, skill of cooking, skill of using media etc.
Let’s equip our AOJ people to do some service to humanity!  Jesus served the humanity!<br> </p> 


<p>Let's ask pardon for all the sins, scandals, omissions committed by the Church in India in the past 2000 years!</p><br><br>

<h2>Message 8.2.2020</h2>

<p>Jos 8:18  And Jehovah said to Joshua, Stretch out the spear in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear in his hand toward the city. <br>

The Lord teaches His sons various tactics for war. 
Here Joshua is asked to stretch out the spear towards Ai. The Lord  gave it into his hand.<br>
In  India we were asked to  inherit the land in January. We obeyed. 
 Now this month, February, we have to fill it with Troop Churches and Gift Schools. <br>
This is the only way we can drive away the enemy from the land. 
The enemy has to flee from the place where true  worship takes  place. When Troop Church starts functioning, the enemy will flee. We need not even fight with him. <br>

Num 33:51-53  Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When you have passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan,   then you shall drive out all those who live in the land from before you, and destroy all their carved images, and destroy all their molded images and pluck down all their high places. And you shall possess the land, and live in it. For I have given you the land to possess it. <br>
We already saw the aftereffects of Israelites'  not driving the enemy from their land. They will remain there forever.<br>
Every single inch of land should be occupied after inheriting. If you leave any small portion unoccupied, the enemy will hide there. The Region  should be divided into States, States into  districts, Districts into towns or villages, villages into streets or families.
In every street, Troop Church should be started in a house. There should not be any single street left out, where Troop Church is not started. </p>
<ol>For this the steps to follow.
<li>	You have to communicate this message to everybody. We shared it in the Regional  Coordinators meet on Wednesday 5.2.2020. Now we are sharing it in this  Conference Prayer today  8.2.2020 for State Speakers.</li>
<li>	Next  to your Zonal Coordinators. Every State which has more than 10 Constituencies should be divided into Zones of 10 each. You are the  State Coordinators . You  will  share today's discussions and Message  with your Zonal  Coordinators on Saturday evening or Sunday morning. Sunday evening the Zonal coordinators will share the same with their local smps. So the Message, announcements, discussion, decision we share among ourselves  will reach every  smp in India in 4 days. One example is shown in the column below. </li>
<li>	This way we 543  together will stretch out our spear towards  enemy satan every week. He will flee from our nation. Obedience to what the Lord says will bring the result. </li>
<li>	Be alert to see the openings which the Lord is giving. Churches are being opened. Believers are coming forward to attend gift schools, to become smps, and to conduct BFFs. </li></ol>
