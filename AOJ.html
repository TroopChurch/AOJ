<header><B><I>Vision about India 2006-2020, THE ARMY OF JESUS</I></B></header>
<h1>Revelations from the Lord from 2006 onwards</h1>

<p>1.	The Lord has selected 14 years (from 2007-2014) to bring a great transformation in our country India. The first seven years i.e. from 2007-2013, will be years of abundance and the next seven years 2014-2020 will be years of famine or a severe persecution.</p>

<p>2.	During the first seven years we are supposed to sow seeds of gospel everywhere in our country..  The Lord will give us a great harvest. After that the Church in India will go through a Freedom Struggle</p>

<p>3.	There will not be freedom of  public worship during those period.  There will be a great famine for the Word of God throughout the country. Worship places will be destroyed. Believers will be scattered. There will be only underground churches. Yes, that will be the time the Church  pays the greatest  and last price to win the  country for Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>4.	The Lord wants His Church to plan judiciously and  to act  meticulously in order to face this period. He wants you to follow the example of Joseph in Egypt as He did appoint supervisors to collect one fifth of the produce of the abundant years and to preserve it in barns so that it will be a reserve against the famine period.</p>

<p>5.	The Church in India, irrespective of the denominations, has to release one fifth of its believers, the best part of your church, get them trained and send them to the mission places in India.</p>

<p>6.	In this all the Churches should stand united and competitive.</p> 

<p>7.	The sufferings the Church underwent in Orissa, Karnataka and other places were because of the disobedience of the Indian Church. i.e. It did not stand united and it did not release its 20%.</p>

<p>8.	Even the particular Churches (by name) which received severe blows should examine the reasons for it in the light of receiving, accepting or not accepting this vision from the Lord.</p>

<p>9.	The one fifth portion collected and gathered thus from the Church in India will be the Army that fights for the Jehovah and are called the “Hill Horses”. During the first 7 years they should be hidden in all parts of the country, in every nook and corner of India.</p>

<p>10.	They will proceed like a whirlwind from the South of the country and fight against the “Desert Horse”  the powers of darkness, centralized in the North, and win the country for Jehovah.</p>

<p>11.	After that India will be declared a Christian  country and the country will become the Lord’s. In those days, the continents of America, Europe and Australia  will look towards India for food. They will come to India seeking first food grain and then seed grain. The Church in India has to equip herself for this.</p> 

<p>12.	This is the Lord’s plan All who cooperate with this, will be blessed.  Those who refuse to cooperate will be punished.</p> 


<p>13.	The Lord wants the Indian Church  to rebuke and  condemn the materialistic, the flesh dominating outlook of the Western Churches.</p> 

<p>14.	The Lord is going to raise the Indian Church as a Model Church for the whole world.</p>

<p>15.	The Church in India should shake off its  ‘grasshopper attitude’, (inferiority complex) and should become self confident. All the mighty children of Anak are going to be bread  for us.  The Church should raise its eyes and see the mighty marvelous works the Lord is already doing in our country.</p>

<p>16.	The Lord is going to purify each area of work field in our country. Churches should ask Evangelists to organize gospel meetings separate for each trade; Railway workers, Nurses, Clerks, vendors, farmers,  rickshaw drivers, judges, sweepers, engineers etc. in the country on large scale. Those who are saved will be added to the Church. The no. will increase day by day.</p>

<p>17.	All the Churches should be given a North Indian Orientation, our eyes should be focused on the North. All the Churches should buy lands in North India.  Each believer should be encouraged to buy lands in North  India.</p>

<p>18.	The Lord commands its Church to take a statistical survey  of all the trials, tribulations, sufferings it has undergone down through the ages and is undergoing now in India. It should be prepared  block/Taluk wise, district wise, State wise and the nation as a whole with minute details with dates. All the local Churches should be invited to prepare this. The Lord showed the Church in Bangalore as a model for this. The other Churches also should follow suit.</p>

<p>19.	All the Churches should come forward to adopt  a village or a district in  North India. They should release their personnel and resources towards this.</p>

<p>20.	The South Indian Churches are commanded not to invest money in immovable properties.  If they do,  their hearts will break when they see the fruit of their hands destroyed or burnt down  in front of their eyes.</p>

<p>21.	All the South Indian Churches should encourage their believers to migrate to North. An exodus should take place.</p>

<p>22.	The Non Indian Residents of India are to be invited to come back to our country so that they can labour and  can have a share in the blessings of the harvest.</p>

<p>23.	The servants of God are not to go to foreign countries for fund raising.  The  foreign churches are asked  to come to India to attend  meetings and services here.</p>
