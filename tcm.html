				<b>Ezek. 37:1-14.<br>
				 The Lord raises an Army from  dry bones. Out of hopelessness new life begins. As Ezekiel spoke to the dry bones  speak to your body, every part of it-  nerves, bones, ligaments, muscles, skin,  all  other organs  to be renewed with God’s breath. Speak to your soul – mind, will and emotions (depression, guilt, shame, rejection, loneliness, inferiority, poor self-image, lack of ambition, lack of vision, hatred, bitterness, jealousy, self-glory, vain glory,  unhealthy competition, judging others, bondage of divisions, bondage of religiosity, lust, sinful life discriminating others etc…) to be transformed  by God’s breath. <br> Speak to your spirit- enthusiasm, joy, peace, faith, hope, prayerfulness, alertness, time consciousness, etc….<br>
				You will find yourself coming out of the grave, many graves, graves of enmity, hopelessness etc. Jesus has given you a new life!

				<b>Mark 16:17-18, Mat 10:1, Lk. 9:1, 10:19. <br>These are the  5 signs of a believer:<br>
	<ol><li>	Casting out demons</li>
	<li>	Speaking in new tongues</li>
	<li>	Handling serpents to destroy the  activities    of Satan.</li>
	<li>Drink poisonous things. Nothing will harm</li>
	<li>	Lay hand on the sick. They will be healed. </li></ol>
 From the very same day one accepts Jesus, these signs will appear. As a child learns  the first letters of alphabet ABCDE in a school,  these 5 signs will immediately come into effect in a believer. In the 2nd sitting,  this  should be  practised among believers in Troop Churches and outside. Narrate examples.

				<b>The Great two commandments – <ol><li>Loving God & </li><li>Loving your neighbour.</li>
Loving God : <br>
Exo20:4-5, Deu 5:7-10, Lev19:4;, Exo20:23, Exo23:24, Exo34:17; Deu4:16-19, Deu5:8-9, Deu16:21-22, Deu27:15; Psa97:7, Psa115:4-8; Isa2:20, Isa44:9-20, Isa48:5-8; Jer10:3-8; Act17:29; Rom2:22-23; 1Co10:19-20; Rev13:14-15, Rev22:15<br>
Loving God with all your heart & with all your soul demands  keeping oneself away from all forms of occult involvement like Magic, sorcery, astrology, Yoga, Netra jyotisha, divination (parrot, lizard, evil possessed people, palmistry, horoscope, fortune telling by stars, (ref Know your Enemy DVD episode no.8) Rekhi, Pranic healing, witchcraft. Black magic, Ouija board etc.<br>
Loving neighbour: <br>
Mark 12:30-33, Deu 6:4, 10:12, 30:6, Pro. 23:26, Mat 10:37, Lk 10:27, 1 Tim 1:5, Mat 22:37-39, Lev 19:13, Mat 7:12, Rom 13:8-9, 1 Cor 13:4-8, Gal 5:14, James 2:8, 12-13, 1 Jn 3:17-19, 1 Jn 4:7-8, 21, Mat 5 full .<br>
If you really love your neighbour, the best  way of expressing it is  guaranteeing him eternal life by introducing Jesus to him and making him a disciple of Jesus. <br>
Finding 10 new souls for making disciples and fixing the place for new Troop Church. Praying for it.<br>

				<b>New Testament Worship –offering body as a living , holy,  acceptable sacrifice 
 Rom. 12:1-2.<br>
All human beings have tendencies to offer something to God the Creator. Various offerings in various religions
Flowers, incense, hair, money, first fruits of harvest, animals, bulls, wine etc. What the  Lord says about this , Ps. 50:10-14
Every animal of forest and every bird in the sky is mine.<br>
In  the Old Testament those who offered lame, blind animals received punishment from God. 
Malachi: 1:6,8,11, 2:1-3.<br>
Our body should be offered as a blameless sacrifice.<br> 
Have a check-up before offering it! .<br> 
Are my eyes holy? Mat 5:27-29<br>
Is my  tongue holy or defiled? Mat 5: 22, 12:36, James 3:2, 5-6, 8-11. 
When the fleshly body is offered as a sacrifice, every organ, cell in it offered as a burnt offering, (Lev. 1:6) mind will get transformed. (Rom 12:2)<br>
Result? Will be able to discern what is pleasing to God, what is the perfect will of God. <br>
We will become a new creation (2 Cor. 5:17), not conformed to the world. (Mat 5,6,7 chapters recommended)<br>

At the end of 3 years,  Jesus’ training looks to be incomplete&  a failure in the eyes of the world. But He knew His time to leave them has come. He entrusted them to the Father, Jn 17:1-26. <br>
Offering Himself as a sacrifice was the completion and culmination  of His training them. Phil 2:4-11<br>
Anointing &dispersal for starting new troops. <br>

<li>	The  World  James 4:4. Lk. 16;15.</li></ol>
The 3 main weapons of Satan:<br>

<li>	Attachment: Lk. 14:25,26, 9:23-26, Lk.8:20,21, Gen. 22:1,2. 
Overcome this temptation of attachment to persons, places by detaching oneself in such a way  that  God could be given first and foremost place in your life. </li>

In exceptional cases of new believers, if they seem to be immature in the discernment of good and evil (Heb. 5:13-14) they could be kept with the leader for some more time, but it should not exceed 1 month.
Before  the anointing, the members should be made to fill up the Troop Application for the new troop with new troop members. Just before the concluding prayer, each one will  lay their hands over the names written and prophecy Ezek. 37:4-6.</b>
